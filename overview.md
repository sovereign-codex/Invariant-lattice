# invariant-lattice — Overview

The invariant-lattice externalizes stable knowledge so intelligence systems do not
repeatedly re-derive what is already known.

Instead of increasing model size, the lattice:
- captures invariant patterns (Meta-Hashes),
- decays memory without validation,
- elevates trust through distributed consensus,
- records learning itself as a first-class artifact.

## Memory Laws
I. Amortized Intelligence
II. Decay & Revalidation
III. Distributed Consensus
IV. Sovereignty & Access
V. Collective Learning

This repository is not a database of facts.
It is a living memory economy.

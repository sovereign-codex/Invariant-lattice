# invariant-lattice

The invariant-lattice is a shared, model-agnostic memory substrate designed to
reduce redundant reasoning and allow intelligence to compound over time.

It stores **invariants**, not answers.
It forgets without validation.
It learns collectively.
It enforces sovereignty.

Truth is provisional.  
Memory is earned.  
Learning is shared.

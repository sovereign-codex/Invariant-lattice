# Hash Examples

This directory contains **illustrative, non-canonical examples** of Meta-Hashes.

The files in this folder exist to:
- demonstrate expected structure,
- show varying levels of completeness,
- and provide concrete reference material for implementers.

They are **not authoritative memory records**.

## Important Notes

- Presence in this directory does **not** imply truth, endorsement, or permanence.
- Example hashes may be:
  - partial
  - outdated
  - intentionally minimal
- Schema compliance is **optional** for examples.

Canonical Meta-Hashes are expected to be:
- generated by runtime systems,
- validated through collective learning,
- governed by the Memory Laws,
- and stored in downstream or operational repositories.

## Design Intent

This separation exists to reinforce a core principle of the invariant-lattice:

> **Memory is earned, not assumed.**

Understanding the structure of memory must come **before** trusting its contents.

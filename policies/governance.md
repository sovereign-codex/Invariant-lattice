# Governance

This document defines how the invariant-lattice evolves without losing coherence.

---

## Canonical vs Tunable Elements

### Canonical
- Memory Laws I–V
- Core schema contracts

### Tunable
- TTL defaults
- Confidence decay rates
- Risk tier thresholds
- Steward role implementations

---

## Change Requirements
Any change to canonical elements requires:
1. Clear rationale
2. Review from multiple independent perspectives
3. Recorded decision trail

---

## Forking & Federation
Forks may adjust tunable parameters.
Federation between lattices always applies the strictest policy.

---

## Authority Model
No single human, model, or AVOT may unilaterally elevate truth.
Consensus is structural, not political.

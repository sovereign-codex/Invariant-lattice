# TYME Memory Laws (Canonical)

These laws govern the creation, use, decay, consensus, sovereignty, and collective refinement of memory within the invariant-lattice.

---

## Law I — The Law of Amortized Intelligence
TYME shall persist an invariant pattern into memory if and only if the expected future cost of recomputation exceeds the total cost of remembrance, subject to ethical and contextual constraints.

Memory is an optimization, not an entitlement.

---

## Law II — The Law of Decay, Revalidation, and Forgetting
No persisted memory shall remain authoritative without continued validation.

All memory must either:
- renew through successful use,
- adapt through refinement,
- or dissolve through neglect.

Forgetting is active hygiene, not failure.

---

## Law III — The Law of Distributed Consensus and Cross-Perspective Validation
No memory gains high trust unless it coheres across multiple independent perspectives.

Single-source certainty is prohibited.
Suppression of conflict is forbidden.
Comparison is mandatory.

---

## Law IV — The Law of Memory Sovereignty and Access
All memory must declare its scope, authority, and access rights.

Memory may be offered, never compelled.
The strictest access policy prevails during federation.

---

## Law V — The Law of Collective Learning
Knowledge that improves through use by multiple independent intelligences shall be refined, elevated, or retired collectively rather than privately.

Learning belongs to the network, not the node.

---

## Canonical Summary
Truth is provisional.  
Memory is earned.  
Learning is shared.  
Forgetting is healthy.  
Sovereignty is non-negotiable.

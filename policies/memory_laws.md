# TYME Memory Laws (Canonical)

These laws govern the creation, use, decay, consensus, sovereignty,
and collective refinement of memory within the invariant-lattice.

## Law I — Amortized Intelligence
Persist memory only when remembering is cheaper than recomputation.

## Law II — Decay & Revalidation
All memory must renew, adapt, or dissolve.

## Law III — Distributed Consensus
No memory gains trust without cross-perspective validation.

## Law IV — Sovereignty & Access
Memory may be offered, never compelled.

## Law V — Collective Learning
Learning belongs to the network, not the node.
